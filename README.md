Thanks for checking it out :)

If you would like to deploy this application, please contact me @ erichollman96@gmail.com

Thank you :)

This application is NOT prepared for integrations, but may be useful for independant teaching such as a tutor or group training where you want to track group learning or reflect on teaching efficacy (that's how I use it for now)

The current version _is the developer version_ and includes many hard-coded values... without an environment, it has limited capabilities and is _not_ ready for any plug-and-play functionality, some technical familiarity is required to make any use of it, and it includes many assumptions of grading and dummy-data in the code. 

Glad to provide this to the Yardley Fire Department of Pennsylvania for their youth fire safety training program :)
